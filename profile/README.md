# 3innielee-solved 🧩

Welcome to **3innielee-solved** — a curated collection of projects where I focus on **solving real-world problems with data, engineering, and AI**.  

This is more than just code. Each project highlights:  
- ✅ The **problem statement** (what challenge needed solving)  
- 🛠️ The **technical decisions** (why I chose specific tools and approaches)  
- 🚀 The **solution outcome** (what was achieved, and its impact)
